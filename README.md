## Virtual-Labs

​Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's Virtual Labs initiative leverages advanced computer simulation technology to create realistic laboratory environments accessible via the internet. This program aims to bridge the gap between institutions equipped with physical laboratories and those that are economically disadvantaged or geographically remote, particularly in disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biotechnology. ​


Developed under the National Mission on Education through ICT by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, these virtual labs offer students the opportunity to perform experiments online, facilitating experiential learning without the need for physical lab infrastructure. The VALUE (Virtual Amrita Laboratories Universalizing Education) initiative has been instrumental in creating these virtual labs across various science and engineering disciplines. ​
