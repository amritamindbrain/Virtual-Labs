### 1. Biosignal Processing and Analysis Lab
This lab provides a platform for EEG data analysis and visualization for understanding the correlations of neural activity through electroencephalography data. Experiments designed in this lab help student communities to acquire expertise on fundamental tools that were necessary to describe, analyze and process common biological signals. With the recent trends of interest from computational neuroscience research, the experimental strategies were featured with models of neurons to understand general properties of neural networks and to graphically visualize how biological neurons work with computational efficiency. The lab focuses on an open-source signal analysis platform that can also be extended by students from across the internet.

### 2. Bioinformatics and Data Science in Biotechnology Lab
In this lab, students will be able to learn and practice basics of R programming. Students can expand their skillset in R programming by reading and writing biological sequence data in R platform. Educating this will allow users to learn how to use R as an open source language for learning bioinformatics data processing. Specifically, this lab will help analyse biological sequence data using simple R code snippets. With the features such as flexibility, data handling and modelling capabilitie R programming has been a widely accepted software tools for bioinformatics. It also supports the creation and use of self-describing data structures. With the trends in data science, the lab focuses on FOSS implementations which can be further utilized as laboratory manual or reference material for life science students.
