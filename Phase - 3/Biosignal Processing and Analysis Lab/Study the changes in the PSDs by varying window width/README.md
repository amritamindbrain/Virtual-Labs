### About the Experiment 

​The experiment "Study the changes in the PSDs by varying window width" focuses on analyzing how different window widths affect the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG signals. By adjusting the window width, participants can observe variations in brain rhythms—such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—across different brain regions. This investigation aids in understanding event-related EEG epochs during specific cognitive tasks and characterizing the magnitude and phase information of EEG signals on a millisecond time scale. The experiment also involves computing and visualizing event-related changes in sensory, cognitive, or motor actions through time-frequency representations of spectral density.
